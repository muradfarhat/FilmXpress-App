# FilmXpress App

FilmXpress App is a powerful and intuitive iOS application that offers a seamless and immersive movie-watching experience. Built with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, it provides a well-structured and maintainable architecture for developers while delivering a user-friendly interface for movie enthusiasts.

## Overview

FilmXpress App leverages the latest technologies to provide a feature-rich movie-watching experience on iOS devices. With a sleek and intuitive design, the app allows users to browse through a vast collection of movies, view detailed information, and stay up to date with the latest releases.

## Features

The FilmXpress App comes with the following key features:

#### Movie Listing

* Upon launching the app, users are presented with a comprehensive list of movies. Each movie entry includes essential details such as the movie poster, name, status, type, and schedule. The schedule provides information about the movie's airtime on television, including the days and times it will be broadcasted.

#### Detailed Movie Information

* Users can select any movie from the list to view more in-depth information. Navigating to the movie's dedicated page, users can explore additional details such as the movie poster, name, type, genres (e.g., drama, action, etc.), and a comprehensive summary. This allows users to make informed decisions about what movies to watch based on their interests.

#### SDWebImage Integration

* FilmXpress App utilizes the powerful SDWebImage library to efficiently download and cache movie posters. This ensures smooth scrolling and optimal performance when browsing through the movie list. The integration with SDWebImage enhances the app's overall responsiveness and user experience.

#### Multiple API Support

* The app incorporates a network engine and endpoint to retrieve data from a specific API. Since FilmXpress App supports multiple APIs, each with its own unique identifier, users can access a diverse range of movie collections. The flexible architecture enables seamless integration of new APIs in the future.

#### Pagination and Data Refresh

* FilmXpress App implements pagination functionality, enabling users to load more movies from the API based on the page number. This ensures that users can explore a larger selection of movies beyond the initial set. Additionally, the app features a pull-to-refresh mechanism, allowing users to reload the data and stay up to date with the latest movie information.
